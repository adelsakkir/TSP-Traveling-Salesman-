# TSP-Traveling-Salesmen
The following approaches were used to solve several instances of the travelling salesman problem. 

1. MILP - Can solve instances upto 100 cities in reasonable times
2. 2 OPT
3. 2 OPT - Randomised (An interesting approach by construction of convenient PDF to replace arcs)
4. 3 OPT - Randomised

This project aims to solve the following instances of the travelling salesman problem 

1. 51 Cities
2. 100 Cities
3. 200 Cities
4. 574 Cities
5. 33810 Cities

Attached below are few optimsed routes found by different algorithms for the above instances
